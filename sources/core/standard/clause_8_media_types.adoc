== Media Types for any data encoding(s)

JSON media types that would typically be supported by a server that supports JSON are:

* `application/geo+json` for joined data outputs, and

* `application/json` for all resources.

The typical HTML media type for all "web pages" in a server would be `text/html`.

=== Joined Data Outputs

The server implementations are required to support the media type `application/geo+json` for the joined data outputs.

The server implementations may support any other media types for the joined data outputs.

=== Problem Details Media Types

The media type that would typically be supported by a server that supports the Problem Details response defined in <<rfc7807,RFC 7807>> is `application/problem+json`.
