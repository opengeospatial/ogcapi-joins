[[core-overview]]
=== Overview

The OGC API - Joins core requirements class specifies three operation sets: __discovery operations__, __data joining operations__ and __file joining operations__. <<core-overview-table,Table 4>> contains an overview of the operations specified in the core module.

__Discovery operations__ defines operations for accessing the API landing page, the API definition document, and the information on the server implementation's conformance to the Joins API Standard. 

__Data joining operations__ defines operations for accessing metadata and key values on the feature collections that are available on the server, operations for joining data from input data files with the collections, and operations for accessing and deleting the created joins.

__File joining operations__ defines operations for joining data from input data files directly with other input data files.

The core requirements class specifies the following input data file format support:

* CSV format for the __data joining operations__.
* CSV and GeoJSON format for the __file joining operations__.

include::./requirements/core/REQ_operations.adoc[]

*Overview on the functionalities*

The `Landing page` (path `/`) provides an entry point to the API. It contains links to:

* The `API definition` (link relations `service-desc` and `service-doc`).
* The `Conformance declaration` (path `/conformance`, link relation `http://www.opengis.net/def/rel/ogc/1.0/conformance`).
* The `Collections` (path `/collections`, link relation `http://www.opengis.net/def/rel/ogc/1.0/data`).
* The `Joins` (path `/joins`, link relation `joins`).

The `API definition` describes the capabilities of the server that can be used by clients to connect to the server or by development tools to support the implementation of servers and clients. Accessing the `API definition` using HTTP GET returns a description of the deployed API implementation instance. The API definition can be hosted on the API server(s) or on a separate server.

The `Conformance declaration` states the conformance classes from standards or community specifications, identified by a URI, that the API implementation instance conforms to. Clients can - but are not required to use this information. Accessing the `Conformance declaration` using HTTP GET returns the list of URIs of conformance classes implemented by the server.

Accessing the `Collections` using HTTP GET returns a list of feature collections that are available on the server. 

Each `Collection` element in the Collections list can be accessed further in order to get the metadata on each individual Collection by making an HTTP GET request at path `/collections/{collectionId}`.

Accessing the `Collection's Key Fields` using HTTP GET at path `/collections/{collectionId}/keys` provides information on the key fields of a Collection.

Accessing the `Collection's Key Field` using HTTP GET at path `/collections/{collectionId}/keys/{keyFieldId}` provides the key values of the specific key field. The data joining is executed through these key values.

Accessing the `Joins` using HTTP GET returns a list of Joins that are available on the server. 

New `Joins` can be created by making a HTTP POST query at path `/joins`. This is done by joining data from input data file with a Collection available on the server. 

Each `Join` element in the Joins list can be accessed further in order to get the metadata on each individual Join by making an HTTP GET request at path `/joins/{joinId}`.

Each `Join` can be deleted by making a HTTP DELETE request at path `/joins/{joinId}`.

The data from the input data file can be joined directly with other input data file(s) by making a HTTP POST request at path `/filejoin`.

=== HTTP 1.1
[[req_core_http]]

include::./requirements/core/REQ_http.adoc[]

=== HTTP Status Codes

<<http_status_codes,Table 5>> lists the main HTTP status codes that clients should be prepared to receive. This includes support for specific security schemes or URI redirection. In addition, other error situations may occur in the transport layer outside of the server.

[[http_status_codes]]
.Typical HTTP status codes.
[width="100%",cols="1,6"]
|===
^|*Status code*|*Description*
^|200 |	A successful request.
^|201 |	The request was executed successfully and it resulted in one or more resources that were created.
^|204 |	A request was executed successfully and there is no additional content in the response payload body.
^|302 |The target resource was found but resides temporarily under a different URI. A 302 response is not evidence that the operation has been successfully completed.
^|303 |	The server is redirecting the user agent to a different resource. A 303 response is not evidence that the operation has been successfully completed. 
^|304 |	An entity tag was provided in the request and the resource has not changed since the previous request.
^|307 |	The target resource resides temporarily under a different URI and the user agent MUST NOT change the request method if it performs an automatic redirection to that URI.
^|308 |	Indicates that the target resource has been assigned a new permanent URI and any future references to this resource ought to use one of the enclosed URIs.
^|400 |	The server cannot or will not process the request due to an apparent client error. For example, a query parameter had an incorrect value.
^|401 |	The request requires user authentication. The response includes a WWW-Authenticate header field containing a challenge applicable to the requested resource.
^|403 |	The server understood the request, but is refusing to fulfill it. While status code 401 indicates missing or bad authentication, status code 403 indicates that authentication is not the issue, but the client is not authorized to perform the requested operation on the resource.
^|404 | The requested resource does not exist on the server. For example, a path parameter had an incorrect value.
^|405 |	The request method is not supported. For example, a POST request was submitted, but the resource only supports GET requests.
^|406 |	Content negotiation failed. For example, the Accept header submitted in the request did not support any of the media types supported by the server for the requested resource.
^|500 |	An internal error occurred in the server.
|===

The return status codes described in <<http_status_codes,Table 5>> do not cover all possible conditions. See <<rfc7231,IETF RFC 7231>> for a complete list of HTTP status codes.

[[per_core_additional-status-codes]]
include::./requirements/core/PER_additional_status_codes.adoc[]

When the server encounters an error during the processing of the request, the server may wish to include information in addition to the status code in the response. Since Web API interactions are often machine-to-machine, a machine-readable report would be preferred. <<rfc7807,IETF RFC 7807>> addresses this need by providing "Problem Details" response schemas for both JSON and XML.

[[problem_details]]
include::./requirements/core/REC_problem_details.adoc[]

=== Support for Cross-Origin Requests

If the data is located on another host than the webpage ("same-origin policy"), access to data from a HTML page is by default prohibited for security reasons. A typical example is a web-application accessing feature data from multiple distributed datasets.

[[cross-origin]]
include::./requirements/core/REC_cross_origin.adoc[]

Two common mechanisms to support cross-origin requests are:

* link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing[Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)]

* link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP[JSONP (JSON with padding)]


=== API Landing Page

The HTTP GET operation at service root path `{root}/` returns the API landing page document. The API landing page provides a starting point for the use of the API implementation instance and contains links to the:

* API definition document.
* Conformance information.
* Metadata on collections available on the server.
* Joins available on the server.

[[rc_encodings]]
== Requirements Classes for Encodings
[[encodings-overview]]
=== Overview

This clause specifies three requirements classes for encodings to be used by implementations of the OGC API - Joins Standard. 

* <<requirements_class_html, HTML>>

* <<requirements_class_json, JSON>>

* <<requirements_class_geojson, GeoJSON>>

Support for the JSON encoding class is mandatory and support for HTML encoding class is recommended.
Support for the GeoJSON format for the joined data output is mandatory.  

[[requirements_class_html]]
=== Requirements Class "HTML"

Geographic information that is only accessible in formats like GeoJSON or GML has two issues:

* The data is not discoverable using the most common mechanism for discovering information, that is the search engines of the Web,

Therefore, sharing data on the Web should include publication in HTML. To be consistent with the Web, it should be done in a way that enables users and search engines to access all data.

This is discussed in detail in document <<SDWBP, Spatial Data on the Web Best Practices>>. The OGC API - Joins Standard therefore recommends supporting HTML as an encoding.
